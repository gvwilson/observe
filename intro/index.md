# Introduction

<p class="subtitle" markdown="1">what this training does and doesn't cover</p>

<div class="callout" markdown="1">

Why productivity?
Because it affords a good mix of "how do we collect and analyze data?",
"when are quantitative and qualitative analysis the right tools?",
and "how do we operationalize a question like this?"
It's also very topical:
most discussions of the impact of AI are vacuous
because we're arguing about performance improvements without first defining performance.
I also hope it will draw interest from both the research community
and research-friendly practitioners.
