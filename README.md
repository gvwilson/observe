# Observability in Software Engineering

-   Plan:
    -   Teach programmers to distinguish reliable research from plausible punditry
    -   Use the problem of programmer productivity as the motivating issue
-   Pro:
    -   Topical: debates about the impact of AI are vacuous without an understanding of what productivity means
    -   Motivates study of both qualitative and quantitative methods
    -   Practical exercises are straightforward to create
-   Con:
    -   Medium effort to create
    -   May be seen as niche:
        people won't understand observability and productivity are just being used as a working example

## Learner Persona

-   Dav, 32, has been working in mobile application development for ten years.
    Originally a front-end developer,
    they now split their time between managing a team of three
    and building out test infrastructure for that team and others.
-   The last two projects that Dav worked on shipped late despite late hours from their team,
    and had an embarrassing number of bugs.
    As a result,
    senior management wants more insight into progress and productivity,
    but Dav is worried that simple metrics like "issues closed per week"
    will be both misleading and abused.
-   Dav wants to learn more about what makes programmers and programming teams productive
    (or unproductive) in general,
    and how to identify problems and bottlenecks without intrusive surveillance.
-   Another release cycle is just about to start,
    so Dav's time is limited:
    they are able to take a day for a workshop,
    but have learned the hard way that they are unlikely to complete books
    or self-paced online courses.
